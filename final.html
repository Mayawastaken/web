      <h3>Project Description</h3>
      <p>My project basically works similarly to a browserâ€™s (such as Google) "suggested search" function, but with respect to a given input data set (a transcript of a Gutenberg book). It will be a "smart suggester", suggesting the top (most frequent) occurrences of 2-word phrases that follow a given input search "seed" (a string of 2, 3, or 4 words).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Instructions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Run the python script from my public_html folder, ie: mdoron-repa30@moe:~/public_html$ ./PythonFinalProject1.py</li>
        <li>Input a 2 word seed (that must appear in the source text (Jane Eyre))... eg "in the" has many permutations</li>
        <li>Close (click the 'X') the histogram when ready</li>
        <li>Repeat steps 2 and 3 with three- and four-word seeds, respectively, from the text (can look at histogram labels to see some possibilities)</li>
        <li>After closing the final histogram, navigate any browser to the webpage: http://moe.stuy.edu/~mdoron-repa30/finalWebsite.html</li>
        <li>Click on the different tabs to see the results!</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>How It Works</h3>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Files</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>PythonFinalProject1.py  - the python script</li>
        <li>JaneEyreForCompSci.txt  - source text</li>
        <li>finalWebsite.html       - main webpage html</li>
        <li>2wordseed.html          - sub webpage (updated by python script)</li>
        <li>3wordseed.html          - sub webpage (updated by python script)</li>
        <li>4wordseed.html          - sub webpage (updated by python script)</li>
        <li>finalWebsite.css        - css file with styles for webpages above</li>
        <li>final.html              - this hmtl file</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Resources</h3>
      <p>N/A<p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Bugs, Errors, and Things to be Aware of</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Search seeds must be inputted exactly as they appear in the text (aside from capitalization), including punctuation.</li>
          <li>There is no check to 'force' the user input to be the right number of words (or exact matches to the source text). We hope users can count to 4 :).</li>
          <li>I had hoped to be able to run the python script directly from a web browser (http://moe.stuy.edu/~mdoron-repa30/PythonFinalProject1.py) -- however, the user input feature doesn't work in my browser, so for now it needs to be run in the moe shell directly.</li>
      </ul>
  </ul>
