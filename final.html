      <h3>Project Description</h3>
      <p>My project basically works similarly to a browserâ€™s (such as Google) "suggested search" function, but with respect to a given input data set (a transcript of a Gutenberg book). It will be a "smart suggester", suggesting the top (most frequent) occurrences of 2-word phrases that follow a given input search "seed" (a string of 2, 3, or 4 words).</p>
