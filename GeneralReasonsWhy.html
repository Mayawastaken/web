<p>Board games are excellent for many, many reasons. Firstly, there's such a wide variety of them, that surely one must appeal to your likings, right? Topics range from strategy and skill-based games, to games almost based on pure luck! Some are team games, some are games against other players; some take hours to finish, and some take minutes. If you look hard enough, you will find a game that suits you :). Another reason board games are great is that they are a fun pastime to play with friends and family! They are also a time to show off your game knowledge and expertise!! In the end, board games help you create fun memories, which is what having fun is all about!
