<p>Board games are excellent for many, many reasons. Firstly, there's such a wide variety of them, that surely one must appeal to your likings, right? Topics range from strategy and skill-based games, to games almost based on pure luck! Some are team games, some are games against other players; some take hours to finish, and some take minutes. If you look hard enough, you will find a game that suits you :). Another reason board games are great is that they are a fun pastime to play with friends and family! They are also a time to show off your game knowledge and expertise!! In the end, board games help you create fun memories, which is what having fun is all about! Up next are three superb, yet different board games; hopefully at least one, if not all, catch your attention :).

<p>When one thinks of a board game, most people immediately think of one: Monopoly! Worthfully so, it is one of the most popular board games in the US! Players take turns rolling dice, moving their character around the board, trying to get monopolies. This game requires skill and a touch of luck (well ok, actually a lot of luck :)). It is super fun to play against your friends and family, and it is definitely worth it to bring to game night. To find out more about the game Monopoly,

<h2>Chess</h2>

<p>However, if you are more into a 1v1 kind of game, then chess is perfect for you! Unlike Monopoly, chess only requires skill and practice -- it is a 1 on 1 game with endless possibilities, stemming from only 9 types of pieces. It is a game where you can think ahead, move tactically, and hopefully beat your opponent. Do you think you can checkmate your opponent? If you want to learn more about how it works,

<p>There are many amazingly fun board games out there that aren't as known to most, and this is one of them. This, unlike many board games, is a cooperative board game where players try to stop a pandemic from spreading and save the world (if only we could do that to COVID...)! Each player has a special strength, and players try to come up with strategies to enhance those strengths, find cures, take them to cities, and save the world. Do you think you and your mates have what it takes? To find out more about Pandemic,
